# Social Extractor UI

The user interface for managing data obtained from social media websites. The site uses authorisation and authentication alongside the Social Extractor Dataservice for accessing most of the content.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Angular 8
- [Social Extractor API](https://github.com/jeffvhuang/social-extractor-api)

### Development server

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/jeffvhuang/social-extractor-ui`
2. In the cloned repo, install dependencies `npm install`
3. Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. If a webpage is not automatically opened, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### App Usage

Please refer to README for the [Social Extractor API](https://github.com/jeffvhuang/social-extractor-api) for default credentials for logging in as admin.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Production
